# Video Uploader Plugin for Castopod v2

This plugin adds an **MP4 upload field** to the episode creation and edit form.

When a video file is uploaded:
- It is stored under `public/media/episodes/<slug>/video/<slug>.mp4`.
- The plugin emits a `VideoUploaded` event containing:
  - The related `Episode` model
  - The absolute path to the uploaded file

Other plugins (such as `video-youtube-sync`, `video-apple-feed`, or `video-spotify-helper`) can listen to this event to automatically:
- Upload the video to external platforms
- Generate separate video RSS feeds
- Link or embed the video in the episode‚Äôs metadata

## Installation

1. Place this folder in `plugins/video-uploader`.
2. Activate it in the Castopod admin panel.
3. When editing or creating an episode, you‚Äôll see a new field:
   **‚ÄúVideo file (MP4)‚Äù**.
4. Once uploaded, integration plugins can handle the new `VideoUploaded` event.

## Example usage

- **YouTube plugin:** listen for `VideoUploaded` and upload the MP4 to YouTube.
- **Apple Video Feed plugin:** listen for `VideoUploaded` and generate `/feed/video`.
- **Spotify Helper plugin:** prompt manual upload to Spotify for Podcasters.
